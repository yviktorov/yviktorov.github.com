The good example of [FirePHP][] usage in Magento has been introduced by [ActiveCodeline][] in his post [Utilize FireBug (and FirePHP) to speed up Magento development][] early this year. Here I would like to show you another place you can utilize that function in :)

**UPDATE:** the FirePHP wrapper class now available as a magento extension though [tinycarts channel][], simply proceed with the following commands under the top directory of your magento instance:

 * `./pear channel-discover tinycarts.github.com`
 * `./pear install tinycarts/Lib_Tinycarts_Debug`

And skip to **usage** example.

## FirePhp wrapper

Create `Firephp.php` file in `lib/Tinycarts/Debug`, or checkout(or download) it from github [TinycartsLibs][].

<script src="http://gist.github.com/369222.js">
</script>

The static `send()` method it's exact copy of `acl()` function introduced by [ActiveCodeline][].

## Usage

Go into one of your template files like `/catalog/product/view.phtml` and call this function like:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/369224.js">
</script>

**NOTE:** to let it send debug messages you have to uncomment `Mage::setIsDeveloperMode(true);` in your index.php *in development environment ONLY!!!*. Next time I'll tell you how to split environment and do not bother index.php at all ;)

**UPDATE:** sinse 1.4 release developer mode can be enabled by defining special environment variable `MAGE_IS_DEVELOPER_MODE` at your development machine, see [configure_magento_error_page][].
