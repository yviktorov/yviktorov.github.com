The good example of [FirePHP][2] usage in Magento has been introduced by [ActiveCodeline][3] in his post [Utilize FireBug (and FirePHP) to speed up Magento development][4] early this year. Here I would like to show you another place you can utilize that function in :)

## FirePhp wrapper

Create `Firephp.php` file in `lib/Tinycarts/Debug`, or checkout(or download) it from github [TinycartsLibs][6].

<script src="http://gist.github.com/369222.js">
</script>

The static `send()` method it's exact copy of `acl()` function introduced by [ActiveCodeline][3].

So, now, all you need to do is to go into one of your template files like `/catalog/product/view.phtml` and call this function like:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/369224.js">
</script>

**NOTE**: to let it send debug messages you have to uncomment `Mage::setIsDeveloperMode(true);` in your index.php *in development environment ONLY!!!*. Next time I'll tell you how to split environment and do not bother index.php at all ;)
